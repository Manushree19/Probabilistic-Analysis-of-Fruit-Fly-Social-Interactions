# Probabilistic-Analysis-of-Fruit-Fly-Social-Interactions
The project “Probabilistic Analysis of Fruit Fly Social Interactions” models Drosophila melanogaster behavior using Dynamic Bayesian Networks and MATLAB. It analyzes male, female, and courtship pairs to uncover synchronization, causal links, and behavioral patterns, bridging biology with data science and machine learning.
